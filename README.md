# Description

`GitRDone` is a hands-on course to get you up to speed with version control using Git â€” the essential step before jumping into DevOps [initiation course](https://github.com/jraillard/parkndeploy).

Learn the fundamentals : what version control is, how Git works (commits, branches, merges), collaboration workflows, and key advanced commands.

Master Git basics and branching strategies to smoothly transition into DevOps practices.

:bulb: This course favors practicing with a Git GUI over command line. Using a GUI better visualizes Git concepts and makes it easier for beginners to grasp version control in action.
